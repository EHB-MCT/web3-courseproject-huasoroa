# **GSAP Animations** by _Ricardo_
In this section I will explain what I did in a small amount of time with GSAP. What were the pain points and the bright points.

## Advantages - ‚òëÔ∏è
- Easy and smoother animations
- Automatic easing functions 
- Animations can be played, stopped, resumed, repeated and reversed.
- Animations can be staggered and delayed
- With the use of timelines it is easier to manage multiple animations at once
## Disadvantages - êÑÇ
- Difficult to maintain readability of code after long timelines
- A bit more difficult for button animations
- Can't handle big images (The bigger the size the less FPS)
- Becomes difficult when handling color and others CSS properties.
